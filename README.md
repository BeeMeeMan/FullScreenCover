# FullScreenCover
In SwiftUI we often use such modifier as FullScreenCover. It is easy to use but it have very limited functionality.
This is a custom LazyFullScreenCover modifier, which will support different animations
and transparent background from the box. And the best thing is that itâ€™s only 50 lines of code.
